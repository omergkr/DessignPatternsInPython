"""
The Adapt design pattern is a reasonably simple pattern which tries to adapt
the interface that you are given to the interface that you actually need
wie travel adapter
We cannot modify our gadgets to support every possible interface
Thus, we use a special device to give us the interface we require from the interface we have

Adapter -> A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y

Summary
Implementing an Adapter is easy
Determine the API you have and the API you need
Create a component which aggregates (has a reference to, ...) the adaptee
Intermediate representations can pile up: use caching and other optimizations
