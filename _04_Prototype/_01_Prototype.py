PROTOTYPE

Complicated objects (e.g cars) aren't designed from scratch
    - They reiterate existing designs
An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a Prototype
We make a copy(clone) the prototype and customize it
    -Requires deep copy support
We make the cloning convenient (e.g via a Factory)

PROTOTYPE -> A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.

SUMMARY
To implement a prototype, partially construct an object and store it somewhere
Deep copy the prototype
Customize the resulting instance
A factory provides a convenient API for using prototypes
